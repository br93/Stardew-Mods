### Description:
Pierre's stock starts with fewer choice and grow larger over the years. He doesn't have all the Y1 crops from the get go, there was no one farming land before you shown up.

### Progression:
######Year 1: only crops from mixed seed and the fruits and vegetables Pierre display on Stardew Valley Fair's Grange Display are available (seed makers can produce their vanilla versions, but you'll need luck, the quality of Pierre's own cultivated products are not that great)

######Year 2: if you're good friend with Pierre, he will change supplier and give you more choices (crops that would usually be available from day 1, plus new items)
Pierre starts selling tree saplings

######Year 3: seeds that usually starts to show up on year 2 will show up on year 3 + there'll be discounts based on number of shipped items
20% : Shipping 250 Cauliflowers, Parsnips and Potatoes OR 250 Hot Peppers, Radishes and Wheat OR 250 Corns, Eggplants and Pumpkins
50% : Shipping 500 Cauliflowers, Parsnips and Potatoes OR 500 Hot Peppers, Radishes and Wheat OR 500 Corns, Eggplants and Pumpkins
70% : Shipping 999 Cauliflowers, Parsnips and Potatoes AND 999 Hot Peppers, Radishes and Wheat AND 999 Corns, Eggplants and Pumpkins

######Year 4: seeds from Sandy starts showing up

######Year 5 (or early, if lucky enough): "upgraded mixed seeds" = produces upgraded version of crops - a golden variety that can produce multiples crops at once (only with Add-on version)

######If you complete the Community Center, fruits, vegetables and forage will sell for more and people will give you credit for good quality products when they buy them from Seed Shop (configurable with this update).

And more...

######Note: Joja will have all the seeds as normal, but if you are not willing to sell your soul just yet, the Travelling Merchant will also have all the crops, but you'll have to rely on RNJesus

######Note 2: This mod doesn't change the progression of modded crops
