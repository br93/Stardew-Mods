![Configuration](https://imgur.com/sw86U3U.png)

* "DisableVanillaEventWithoutMiniHarp": while your harp is still broken, it should be impossible to play the mini harp in the Abigail event. So this config will disable that event until you fix the mini harp
- "BooksellerSellsMusicSheet": if true, there's a random chance, based on RNG and daily luck, that you could buy Music Sheets from the Bookseller after mastery
* "TravellingCartSellsMusicSheet": if true, there's a random chance, based on RNG and daily luck, that you could buy Music Sheets from the Traveler Cart after mastery
- "SpawnMusicBenchAfterMastery": it'll spawn a music bench somewhere in the valley after mastery to show the player that they can use the former Harp Bench to craft Music Sheets
* "ChangeProjectile": it changes the projectile assets to make the Mini Harp trinket shoot notes. If you want to use Magic Quiver, the trinket that the Mini Harp is based of, then you'll need to set this config to "false", otherwise the Magic Quiver will shoot (more powerful) music notes as well
- "ChangeStringForEatingAction": music animations were added via "eating animations", so, for the sake of immersion, instead of prompting you to eat the music sheets and music scrolls, the game will prompt a generic message: "Confirm action?" This will also show up while you're eating food, so if you don't like this change, you can set this configuration to false.

![What come  next](https://imgur.com/2hU4p5T.png)

* First and foremost, I am eager to experience this mod for myself. It was my first "not-so-simple-oh-no-I-spend-a-month-developing-damn-you-feature-creep" mod, but the more I work on it, the more excited I became to try it.
* Balance: I changed so many things already thinking it was too hard, or too easy. Real feedback will be really good to know what still need to change
* New music sheets and power up. I'm open for suggestions and if it's sounds interesting and I'm able to do it with Content Patcher and some help of frameworks (or Discord if I'm stuck) I will try it, 100%
* Probably new events? I loved tinkering with the new modding capabilities of Stardew Valley 1.6, but if there's something I'm not a fan of, is creating events. But if it fits the mood (of the mod, and the modder) and it's a good suggestion, why not?
* Have fun!
