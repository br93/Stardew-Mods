### Description:
This mod adds a lost book written by the Adventure's Guild called Monster Guide, giving information about the monsters in the cave (in which floor they are on, according to Stardew Wiki).

It also adds a bookcase (Lost Bookcase), with 4 vanilla textures to chose from (customizable via Alternative Textures), that makes possible to read the Monster Guide at home, after you find the lost book - you can find it using the same mechanics as usual, digging artifact spots. You can buy the bookcase anytime you want (at Robin's), but you'll only be able to read the Guide after you find the book.
