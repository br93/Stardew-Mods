### Description:
Grange Display becomes a **Farmers Market** and everyone displaying their products will also sell them and more. **Clicking on other's Grange Displays will open their shop**. Except old greedy Pierre, everyone will sell most of their wares at cost price (prices may vary if you use mods that change sell prices).

- **Pierre**: sell his regular shop items (if you download my other mod: Seed Shop Progression Mode, he'll also sell some fruits and vegetables)
- **Marnie**: sell some animal products and one of her favorite food
- **Willy**: sell random gold star fish (useful for one of the mixed bundles) + random fish from every season (winter fish from year 2 onwards)

If you have Stardew Valley Expanded installed:

- **Sophia**: will sell her usual Blue Moon wine, but if you have installed Grapes of Ferngill (by Nrc5Skyrim), she'll also sell some of its Blue Moon wine variants. Also sell her favorite food if its condition is met
- **Susan**: will sell recipes for Seed Maker, Keg, Preserve Jars and Quality Fertilizers if you don't have them yet. She will sell some iridium quality artisan good; and one of her favorite foods. Only accepts Festival Points.
- **Andy**: will sell random forages from every season (winter forage on season 2 onwards), strawberry seeds cheaper than Egg Festival Pierre's and, if you're really lucky, 1 ancient seed at a reasonable price; plus, he will also sell one of his favorite foods, iridium quality bush berries and honey.


### Compatibility:
- Tested with Stardew Valley Expanded + Ridgeside Village + East Scarp + tons of other mods together
- It won't work with mods that change the position of Grange Displays. I'm not aware of any mod that does that, but if one exists, it won't work together with this one
- Any other mod that edit other parts of this or any other festival should work fine
