### Description:
Eggs will be treated as Universal Loved Gifts on Egg Festival day, pairs well with mod [Festive Valley](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8432). Check [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10438) for more details and links for download.

### Configuration:
Start the game with this mod at least once to generate the config.json in the mod folder.
Edit the config.json file or use Generic Mod Config Menu.

* "LovedGift": "allyear" or "festival" :
	 - default is "festival", making eggs and cookies Universal-Loved gifts from Spring 12 to Spring 14, and just those days. 
	 - allyear make them Universal-Loved all year long

* ReallyUniversalLove : "true" or "false" 
	- Personal Preferences sometimes override Universal ones. Set this option to true to circunvent this issue.
	- default: false

. It works with Vanilla NPCs and modded NPC (if a modded NPC has a set personal preference to eggs or cookies, there is a change that it will override the Universal Gift list, so it's not 100% guaranteed that it will work for them. The configuration option "ReallyUniversalLove" only checks Vanilla NPC preferences.

Enjoy.

### Update: 1.0.1

Now it's fully compatible with [Emyn's Alternate Festivals](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9867). This mod will check if you have Emyn's mod installed automatically, and if it's the case, instead of eggs and cookies, the new Universal Loved Gifts will be mushrooms (except Red Mushrooms), Fried Mushroom and Life Elixir. The same configuration options are applicable.

Please delete the old files before applying the update- don't overwrite them.
