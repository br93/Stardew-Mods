* "AlternativeAssets": true or false (default: true)
 - Tea Sets will be functional only if they are placed in the ground, it won't work on tables or end-tables (there they will be just decorative). So, if you think it's weird to put the Tea Set on the ground, there's now an updated asset, made by [w0lfh4wke](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/44870747).

### Add-on

Optional file that makes the Tea Set similar to a Keg, but just for Green Tea. The difference is that it will produce Green Tea in half the time and it will took quality of input in consideration.

You can download just the first file and have automatically daily tea or both files to have the Tea Set to work like a Green Tea-only keg.
